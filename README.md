# React + Vite /FullStack Lab 2
This assignment involves developing a project management application using React.js for front-end rendering. The application's goal is to display a dynamic table showcasing the latest project assignments retrieved from a backend server. Users can view employee details, project names, and start dates within the table. Additionally, the table headers are clickable for reordering based on different criteria. Furthermore, the application specifically showcases only the five latest assignments, sorted by insertion date. The purpose of this assignment is to leverage React.js to create an interactive and intuitive interface for managing project assignments.
